## What is enterprise architecture?

Enterprise Architecture is a systematic process of evaluating, analyzing, planning and executing the implementation of enterprise analysis. Arising from the necessecity of keeping up with rapidly growing technologies, Enterprise Architecture provides a holistic and unencumbered process of constant adaptation and evolution to ever growing market necessities.

It tries to avoid burocratic processes and finds ways to improve integration between the many areas within a company. Now, IT (Information Technology) being a vital part of a growing and relevant business, fluid communication and effective understanding between different areas is vital. Enterpise Architecture takes into account not only these aspects but who is executing them and why are certain aspects of the business more relevant than others. This provides a global analysis of the true goals of a company and tries to build an effective workflow and environment to achieve these goals.

## Goals of enterprise architecture

The "Enterprise Architecture" Stands for effectiveness, efficiency, agility, and continuity of complex business operations. Therefore each company, that uses these kind of architecture, has the next goals.

*Main goals of enterprise architecture:*
- Implement a new business process management methodology.
- Support new products.
- Adapt IT systems to meet new market requirements.
- Estimate required investments in technology modernization.
- Provide reduction in costs and effort for the delivery projects.

## Benefits of enterprise architecture

- *Lower expenses and higher return on investments made in information technology*
Through an adequate evaluation of the existing technology and the search for redundancies within the systems and applications used in the company, it is possible to limit or completely eliminate the expenses associated with the acquisition or development of certain technology.

- *Consolidation of the information systems infrastructures*
It is possible to simplify and unify the multiple platforms and systems used within the same organization.
This is relevant in the case of having a multiplicity of branches dependent on the parent company that do not have a homogeneous IT structure.

- *Documentation and standardization of processes*
Once the existing processes are identified and their optimization is carried out, the next step must be to document their content and proceed to their standardization, to make it a reference standard.
In this way, when anomalies are detected in the processes, it will be much easier to go to the manuals and resolve the conflicts.

- *Preservation of knowledge and corporate memory*
The processes are critical information for the efficient operation of a company, but they are by no means the only relevant knowledge.
Thanks to the modeling of the enterprise architecture, the preservation of this knowledge is possible through the creation of storage repositories.
In addition, the training and adaptation processes of new employees take place more efficiently, since the information is gathered and explained in a detailed and systematic way.

- *Unification and improvement in business decision making, including change management*
The integration of the applications, as well as the visualization of the processes, allow the managers of an organization to have a much broader, updated and plural perspective of the business.
In addition, the modeling of the business architecture allows to respond more effectively to changes in the business, both from the internal point of view, and in everything related to alterations in the market, competition and technological development within the sector.

- *Improved internal communication*
Through the creation of forums, the publication of internal portals and the articulation of other collaboration spaces, it is possible to define a business architecture that substantially improves internal communication.

## Methodologies of enterprise architecture

A wide variety of Enterprise Architecture methodologies exist. But, there are 4 main approaches that a company can use:

 - The Open Group Architectural Framework (TOGAF)
 - THe Zachman Framework
 - Federal Enterprise Architectural Framework (FEA)
 - Gartner

They all vary in there approaches but try to achieve the same goal: Improving and optimizing a companies internal processes to achieve its most important goals. Some are more encompassing of the overall company like the TOGAF, and others focus on more specific approaches like taxonomy or segmentation.
