## Agile Manifest 

There was an increasing need for an alternative to documentation-driven and heavyweight software development processes. So, while 17 people that had knowledge of the area analyzed the methodologies they had, they realized that these methodologies did not work. In result of this they developed the agile manifest. They officialized something that was already known.  

The impact about this manifest was very radical for developers because this concrete the ideas about software development around the world for the last 20 years.  

This manifesto is based on 4 values and 12 principles. 

 ### Agile Values 

- Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools 

- Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation 

- Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation 

- Responding to Change Over Following a Plan.

## Agile Principles 

### 1. “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. " 

This part talks about how we have to present basic working parts that represents little parts of the complete project. Maybe this part can have some issues, but the priority is that this have to work. 

The principal impact of this principle is that gives feedback to the developer, so the product is going to be better every time. This helps to focus on what you can do better. 


### 2. "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage."


This principle is focused in how u can respond to problems you find while you are developing. In older methodologies this has always been an issue and a problem that can make a project fail. This helps to adapt to new problems, and to be more intelligent finding new solutions to new problems. 

### 3. "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale." 

We have to divide the project in smaller parts so we can estimate in a a better way the effort we need to get the job done. The more parts we have, the easier we can see progress. Finally, when a developer sees their progress they feel more motivated. 


### 4. "Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."

It must have the greatest communication between the one who orders the product and the one who develops it, in addition to allowing the software to be more focused on the customer, and helps the same developer to understand the business model, you get to relate to the principle No. 2, through daily meetings and the involvement of more people can maintain that connection.  


### 5. "Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."

When making a team the scrum master has to know how to select those who will be involved, give them the confidence and the desire to participate in the project. In general it is necessary to share the same vision of why or what or what for. 

### 6. "The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."

The human being is a sociable being by nature, it is easier to connect when you have the other person in front of you because the communication is not only written, but corporal, by the tone of voice, etc, that helps a lot to establish bonds or gain confidence, so that the communication about the product between the owner of the product and the developers can be promoted. 

### 7. "Working software is the primary measure of progress."

A functional and useful product now is better than a perfect one later. 

Perfect and detailed documentation does not have to be the priority in development. The priority is to have a functional product. 

Documentation and other external issues to development have to be secondary so as not to generate a bottleneck in development. 

### 8. "Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely." 

Set clear and realistic expectations. 

You have to be realistic with what you can do and what you cannot do, you have to take into account the resources available to you, both human and technical. 

And everyone must agree on what to do, product managers should take care of their developers. 

Effort estimates must be made in each sprint. 

### 9. “Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.” 

Trying to think ahead in the sense of what you will do wrong now you will have to solve later. 

Try to keep the technical and the design clean and clear, this is something that administrators have to keep in mind. 

The development team should be aware of the features they receive as they are difficult, it is best to separate it so that it is not too long and difficult to do. 

### 10. "Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential." 

This principle is very much in accordance with the strategy that the product owner has, the team has to make decisions and follow the most aligned with the objectives of the company or institution, this in order to establish clear objectives for the solution that you want to present. 

### 11 "The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."

The development teams are independent, and they know exactly what techniques to use, what tools and technologies would be suitable for the product. The team must follow their own organization in order to finish the product 

### 12 "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."  

As the fact of being agile is not part of a defined process, this is applied according to the environment and the work team as well as the time that is together to improve development, it is a continuous improvement for the processes.
