## **Understand the Software Development Life Cycle**

The SDLC or Software Development Lifecycle refers to a process that produces software with the highest quality, at the lowest cost and in the shortest time possible. 

These three are the essential characteristics of SDLC:

- Hight quality
- Low cost
- Shortest time possible

## Stages and Best Practices

### 1. What are the current problems?

It is important to get input from all the people who will be using the software to **identify the current problems** and focus everything on improving the current state. 

### 2. What do we want?

The team needs to determine the costs and resources. Also details the risks and provide plans to deal with them. **Planning** is key.

### 3. How will we get what we want?

In this phase the Design Specification is created, this is the design plan. It needs feedback and suggestions from stakeholders. 

This stage is crucial because failure may result in cost overruns or total collapse of the project. 

### 4. Let's create what we want.

The actual development starts. Proper guidelines need to be set. Define the nomenclature, variable naming styles. All best practices. 

### 5. Did we get what we want?

Code testing finds defects and deficiencies that need to be fixed to match the original specifications. 

### 6. Let's start using what we got.

The goal is to start using the product. Maybe deploy it through different development environments and let stakeholders play with the product to catch final mistakes. 

### Extra: software maintenance

Let's try to keep the software up to date. 

## Examples

### Waterfall model

- It's the oldest
- Finish one phase and then start the next
- If details are left incomplete it can hold up the whole process.

### Agile Model

- The product is separated into cycles
- Delivers a working product very quickly
- Heavy emphasis on customer interaction

### Iterative Model

- Emphasized repetition
- A product version can be created quickly and with little cost
- Testing and improvement through successive versions
- It can eat up resources fast

### V-Shaped Model

- Tests at each stage of development
- Similar to waterfall, can run into roadblocks

### Big Bang Model

- Throws most of its resources at development
- Works on small projects
- Lacks the requirements definition stage

### Spiral Model

- The most flexible
- Emphasizes on repetition
- Goes through the planning, design, build and test phases over and over

## Benefits of SDLC

The benefits of SDLC only exist if the plan is followed faithfully.

Some benefits are high level of control and developers understand what they should build and why.
